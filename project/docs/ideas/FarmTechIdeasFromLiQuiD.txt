DNA Digital Card
	-Instead of using the DNA string use a digital card and store all the DNA stats on it.
DNA Digital Card Reader/Writer
	-And add a new machine/computer that reads the card and on which you can change the stats with using the DNA string as a currency. 
	-So if you want to add more health to a mob you need like 15 DNA strings of that mob type per 1 health added.
DNA Spawner
	-It reads the DNA card and then consumes a very large amount of energy/electricity to spawn the mob.
Farming Machine
	-My idea for this machine is to let it create a farming area depended on how much Range Upgrades there were inside the machine.
	-The farm produces waste as a side product of the farm.
Waste
	-Is a liquid side product created by the farming machine.
	-It is distributed through maybe a waste pipe that can be added to Fluid Mechanics or the Sewer block
Sewer
	-As I didn't want to have FM as a must install to transport waste I had this idea in mind for Biotech.
Refinery
	-This machine refines waste in to water and maybe fertilizer?
Cow Milker
	-I don't know if you want to add this machine to FarmTech I just liked the idea to automate the cow milking process.
BioRefinery
	-Maybe this machine can be combined with the other refinery and can be switch to be a refinery for milk or for waste?
Egg Battery(Probably should have a different name)
	-Don't know if this would be nice but having a multiblock machine that uses eggs to spawn chickens on a "threadmill" and generate power?
Woodcutter
	-My original idea was to have this machine put next to a line of trees and let it cut the blocks one by one. 
	-And the length of the line of trees that can be cut is defined by the amount of Range Upgrades inside the woodcutter.
BioCheese
	-Dunno if this would be a nice item to keep in FarmTech. It was produced by putting milk in the BioRefinery and then it would refine the milk into the cheese.
	-It would produce more cheese if you would add seeds.
Sprinklers
	-If you use those with the farming machine, the farming machine will produce a lot more waste.
	-But these machines use fertilizer and water to increase the crop growth.
Milk
	-Maybe make it a placeable liquid/fluid?
	-Needs more uses if the Cow Milker is implemented. Cause the only use now is BioCheese
