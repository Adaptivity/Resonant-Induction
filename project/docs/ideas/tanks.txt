Need improved just a bit to provide better features. Currently the only features are lagless mutli-block networks, and redstone output.

Feature ideas
Auto feed system. Tanks use to have this were they feed machines bellow them with fluids. was original designed to support the tank design and was removed during a rewrite.


Graphics
Though i've been working to reduce graphics so things run better i had a few ideas.
Fluid flow - actually show the fluid moving and sloshing in the tank. 
Connections - show the fluid moving in and out of connected machines/pipe
Wrench support - allow the wrench to turn off side renders. Too improve design and performance.
