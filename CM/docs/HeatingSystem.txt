Idea is to use a 3 part system to generate power from heat.A) Heat producer    Anything that generates heat include engines, generators, reactors, wires, lava, sun, etc. Each object has diffrent heat values    B) Heat conductor    Conducts or stores heat threw diffrent methods. Is very tempory heat storage as it will cool back down without constant heat    C) Heat users    Machines that use the heat for a purpose. This includes boilers, themeral couples, plants, machines, etc.         Each of these will involve some coding to make work correctly. For heat producers it will be a simple output X heat at Y tempature. This will be used by a manager for several uses. Main is to heat the surounding blocks, and world. As well damage, melt, or even chill block if negitive heat value. Heat conductors will work like heat users but will not work the heat. Rather they will decipate and store the heat. These are general block, and metal plates. Heat users will be generators mainly. They will each have there own code set but should use the heat in the same way. X ammount of heat equals W amount of work. Plan is to effect the enviroment with this system as well and create a conflex system. The user will never noticed the system over all. That is unless they abuse the system in some cases. These cases will be working to turn a snow boime into a desert boime using extreme heat output. Since the heat will be mapped to a seperate map with the normal block map it will work with other mods. As well effect entities like the player. If it get to warm the player will take heat damage. Too cold the player can turn into solid ice. Making for very interesting effects.
