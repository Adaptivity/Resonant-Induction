DNA will be used as a way to understand and modify entities by the player. This includes farm animals, monsters, and the player. Though many of the monster, and player tech might show up in other mods but will use the same system. 

First part is the player will need to collect blood from animations and then run it threw some machine. Main machine will be the DNA machine that will encode the DNA into a card that can be read. This DNA then can be taken to another machine to change how the DNA works. Both of these machine can later be combined into a DNA workstation to increase what the player can do. The machine will not use much power though it does take a lot of time to function. Automation should not be allowed on this machine but will later be added to more advanced version that are designed for automation. Reasion for this is to force the player to work for DNA changes since after they changes are refined they are easy to imploy.

To imploy the player will enject the DNA into the living creature. The creature will only slightly change depending on the level and method of the changes. However, the creatures children will take on the changes right away. This will force the player to breed animals inorder to get the changes. As well breeding might be added to create DNA changes between two different sub sets of the same creature. Eg Pink and black sheep to get a either more pink or more black wool.
