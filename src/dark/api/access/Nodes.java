/** Constants that represent nodes by which machines and entities used in combination with
 * ISpecialAccess to limit users on what they can do. These nodes should be used in the same way by
 * all machines, entities, and other mods. Too change the meaning of the node will make it difficult
 * to offer universal meaning for all machines. As well would create the need to add a per node per
 * machine per group access list making it more complicated for users to use.

public class Nodes
{
    /*
     * Rules for using nodes with groups and your machine:
     * 
     * Keep everything the same. 
     *   Eg: Open should be as simple as opening the gui and no more
     *   
     * Enable is not the same as on
     *   Eg: you can disable a machine preventing users from using it
     *   Eg: When enabled the machine can still be turned off
     *   
     * Lock node automatically includes unlock node but not the other way around
     * 
     * 
     * Machine nodes override inv node as inv nodes are only designed for containers.
     *  Machines nodes are global for all guis inside the machine
     *  
     *  
     *  Groups do not need there own nodes. Group.user, Group.owner, Group.admin are designed to flag the default groups. 
     *  
     *  
     * Your machine must always have a group that at least has a owner group. This group should be flagged with Group.owner but is not required.
